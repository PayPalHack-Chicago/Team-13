## Objective
Millions of people across the globe struggle with seemingly endless poverty, and with a lack of education and resources, it's often difficult to escape such a position. We seek to provide people in poverty opportunities to be financially independent, free, and stable by creating a KaiOS app so that the latest information is easily accessible. Phones that KaiOS are astonishingly less expensive than competitors, making it an actually viable option for those who can't afford an expensive phone. We will utilize this technology to provide crucial information to those who need it the most, while simultaneously making the experience as seamless as possible.
